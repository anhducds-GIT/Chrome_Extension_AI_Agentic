# Duc Auto Gemini — Run Ledger

- Run ID: `20260824-dag-v01-000-090-r01`
- Goal: independent Gemini Images extension, review-ready at 90%
- Owner: user
- Executor: `/root`
- Auditor: `/root/dag_acceptance_auditor`
- Current state: `ACCEPTANCE_AUDIT`
- Current phase: `P7 — independent audit/revision`
- Completed phases: `P0 contract`, `P1 baseline`, `P2 scaffold`, `P3 adapter/fixtures`, `P4 integration`, `P5 live DOM read-only`, `P6 full verification`
- Pending phases: `P7 independent audit/revision`, `P8 exact-path commit/push/handoff`
- Open blockers: none for 90%; live runtime remains owner pilot
- Approved gates: continuous GREEN/YELLOW; direct main; exact-path commit/push
- Forbidden: ChatGPT modifications, destructive cleanup, force operations, security bypass, store/account changes
- Acceptance status: `P0–P6 provisional PASS; final auditor pending`
- Next transition: exact-stage Gemini snapshot, commit/push, then Pass B audit

## Phase results

| Phase | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | PASS | Acceptance Contract READY before implementation |
| P1 | PASS | main/origin aligned at baseline; index empty; 52/52 repository tests + observer PASS; unrelated writer paths protected |
| P2 | PASS | independent MV3 package, Gemini-only host, `DAG_*`/`dag.*` namespaces |
| P3 | PASS | deterministic adapter/exact-once/security/attribution fixtures |
| P4 | PASS | XLSX queue, 0/1/multi references, checkpoints, result/audit, collision-safe output |
| P5 | PASS | live empty Images surface mapped; submit count 0; no file upload |
| P6 | PASS | Gemini 10/10; repository 52/52 + observer; syntax/JSON/diff/secret scans PASS |

## 90% boundary

Live generation, installed-extension runtime, full-size output DOM/download, account/model/locale variants and subjective image quality are explicitly `LIVE_RUNTIME_UNVERIFIED / OWNER_PILOT_PENDING`.
